## Introduction
In the age of big data, the ability to efficiently represent and extract insights from structured datasets is crucial for informed decision-making. This project leverages a combination of powerful data science libraries and cloud services to provide a comprehensive solution for knowledge representation and insight generation.

## Features
- **Data Upload and Preprocessing:** Upload datasets, clean, and preprocess them for analysis.
- **Insight Generation:** Utilize machine learning and statistical methods to generate insights.
- **Visualization:** Create interactive and static visualizations to represent data and insights.
- **Knowledge Representation:** Use ontologies and knowledge graphs to structure and visualize relationships within the data.
- **Cloud Integration:** Store and process data using AWS S3 and AWS Lambda for scalability and efficiency.

## Technologies Used
- **Frameworks and Libraries:**
  - [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)
  - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
  - [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/)
  - [Plotly](https://plotly.com/)
  - [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
  - [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
  - [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/)

- **AI and Machine Learning:**
  - [Google Generative AI](https://ai.google/)

- **Cloud Services:**
  - [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
  - [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)

## Setup and Installation
